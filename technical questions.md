	#Technical Answers
1.I spent 3 hours on this technical test. Unfortunately, I didnï¿½t get more time due to the deadline limit and my daily office work.
 If I had time, I would have added the
  -	logging module
  -	Javadoc for each methods
  -	All the inputs(Postal code) would be sent via json file
  -	Would have added few more scenario validations like checking the exact error message text
  -	I would have also added the feature of taking screenshots
	- Runner will be replaced from JUnit to TestNg
  -	I would have also working on integrating with cluecumber plugin which would enrich the reporting of the cases

2.To me the most interesting trend in automation is the "applitools". It drew my attention recently, I am learnig and implementing it in my project as well. This is a AI powered visual testing and monitoring tool which can be sued to test both mobile and desktop devices. Instead of finding the UI elements from DOM, the tool validates via visual monitoring. By this way it covers the cosmetic aspects of a UI as well.

3.I had a chance to automate a legacy application. To my knowledge automating a legacy application is considerably easy since the UI will be stable and there will be very little enhancements to the application. To implement test automation to a legacy application depends on the priority, criticality and lifetime of the application. I would work on automating the replacement application if the legacy application lifecycle is only for weeks and less critical

4.Few improvements for the website to enhance customer experience are,
  -	Determining the customer location based on the GPS/network provider
  -	A banner in the landing page to show the top offers/deals for the customers
  -	Google integration for account creation(similar to facebook)
  -	Menu for restaurants are textual with less pictures. Graphical presentation would make customer visit the website again
5.	JSON Exposure
  -	I have JSON exposure for past 4 years. I worked on both XML and JSON data since the Apis I work use both rest and soap requests
  -	 I am currently doing Rest api testing which has JSON data.
  -	I have also done a project by using GoogleCalendar api and fetching its JSON data using Java
  -	I have worked on api automation using postman and chai language
